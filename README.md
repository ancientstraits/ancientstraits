The github profile of `AncientStraits`.

I like to program in `C`.

Currently, I make `OpenGL` tutorials.

I am also working on a tool called [`codim`](https://github.com/ancientstraits/codim) to automatically create videos using scripting.



I have a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg1OZXQltEW7Mb9px2H8exQ) which specializes in programming tutorials.
